# hackathon-template

Hack the Hackathon has yielded multiple approaches to templates for generating hackathons web sites and organization frameworks:

* From HtHv4: https://github.com/hackthackathon/hackathon-template-github - a github template that will make you a github repo for your hackathon via web interface.
* From HtHv4: https://github.com/hackthackathon/hackathon-template-cookiecutter - a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) command line tool that will set up a repository same as the above.
* From HtHv2: https://github.com/hackthackathon/hackotron-template - an earlier version that inspired the above two.
